## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repositories**

- **Frontend (this repo):**

  ```sh
  git clone <this-repo-url>
  cd blogs_app
  ```

- **Backend (Spring Boot):**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/saalim199/blog_app_backend
  cd blog_app_backend
  ```

---

### 2. **Start the Backend (Spring Boot)**

> **Important:**  
> You must start the backend server before running the Flutter app.

- Follow the backend repository's README for setup instructions.
- Usually:
  ```sh
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run
  # or
  ./gradlew bootRun
  # or
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- Make sure the backend is running and accessible at the URL specified in your `app_secrets.dart`.

---

### 3. **Configure API Endpoints**

- The app uses `lib/core/secrets/app_secrets.dart` for API URLs.
- **Do not edit this file directly.**
- Instead, copy the provided example file and edit your own secrets:
  ```sh
  cp lib/core/secrets/app_secrets.dart.example lib/core/secrets/app_secrets.dart
  ```
- Edit `app_secrets.dart` to match your backend API URLs.

---

### 4. **Install Flutter Dependencies**

```sh
flutter pub get
```

---

### 5. **Run the App**

```sh
flutter run
```

---

## Notes

- Make sure your backend is running and accessible at the URL specified in `app_secrets.dart`.
- For Android emulator, `10.0.2.2` maps to `localhost` on your development machine.
- For iOS simulator or real devices, you may need to adjust the API URL.

---

## Folder Structure

- `lib/core/` - Common utilities, themes, secrets, and cache
- `lib/features/Auth/` - Authentication logic and UI
- `lib/features/blog/` - Blog features, data, domain, and presentation layers

---

## Environment & Secrets

- **Do not commit sensitive information.**
- Use `lib/core/secrets/app_secrets.dart.example` as a template for your own `app_secrets.dart`.
- Add `lib/core/secrets/app_secrets.dart` to your `.gitignore`.

**Happy blogging!**
